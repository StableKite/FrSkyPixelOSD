FrSky Pixel OSD
===============

- Vector based drawing with access to individual pixels.
- No implicit drawing by itself, all drawing commands must be issued by the host.
- Command based interface.


# Drawing system

## Main canvas

The OSD exposes a vector API on top of a fixed size canvas. Hosts shouldn't
make assumptions about the canvas size and instead query the OSD for it using
the `OSD_CMD_INFO` command. Point `(0, 0)` corresponds to the top left of the
canvas, with `Y` coordinates increasing downwards and `X` coordinates increasing
to the right.

## Current Transformation Matrix

The drawing system allows arbitrary affine transformations by implementing a
3x3 Current Transformation Matrix. This matrix can be used to e.g. rotate
and/or scale any lines or shapes drawn into the canvas. The API provides
several helper functions for easily manipulating the matrix.

Most functions manipulate the matrix by creating a temporary matrix `M` (where
M can be a translation, scale rotation...) and setting `CTM = CTM x M`. For some
functions, there's a reverse function provided (ending with the `_REV`) prefix)
that performs the multiplication in reverse i.e. `CTM = M x CTM`.

## Context stack

Sometimes it can be useful to change the state of the drawing system to render some
shapes and then restore it to its previous state. This is accomplished via a context
stack. The graphics context stores the following information.

- Current transformation matrix
- Color Inversion
- Stroke color
- Stroke width
- Fill color
- Outline type
- Outline color
- Cursor position
- Clipping rect

Contexts can be pushed and popped with `OSD_CMD_CONTEXT_PUSH` and
`OSD_CMD_CONTEXT_POP`, respectivelly.

## Transactions

To minimize flickering, the OSD uses a multiple buffered drawing pipeline. This
allows seamlessly drawing complex shapes without displaying partial results on
the screen. Additionally, profiled transactions can be used to measure the
performance of the drawing code. If no transactions are used, drawing is
performed directly on the output buffer.

# API

## Command structure

All commands must have at least one byte. This first byte indicates the command
identifier, while the rest are totally dependent on each command.

Most command have fixed sized payloads. Commands with variable sizes explicitely
include the size for variable parts (e.g. commands for drawing strings).

## Responses and errors

Generally, commands don't generate a response. The few ones that do are explicitely
documented to do so. The response to a command `C` will be returned with its same
command identifier.

Errors are reported using the special `0` command followed by the command identifier
that generated the error and an error code, both as `uint8_t`.

## UART API

The OSD exposes its API over uart, using an `115200/8-N-1` configuration. Over UART,
each frame consists of the following:

- Header: `$A` (2 bytes)
- Frame length: `uvarint_t` representing the number of bytes that follow after this value
- Any number of commands
- A CRC8 using the `0xD5` polynomial and with the initial value `0` (also known as DVB-S2)
  covering everything but the header

## Types

### uint8_t
An unsigned byte in the `[0, 2^8 - 1]` interval.

### uint16_t
An unsigned short using little endian representation in the `[0, 2^16 - 1]` interval.

### float32
An IEEE 754 32 bit floating point using little endian representation.

### osd_point_t
A point with 12 bit signed `X` and `Y` coordinates, both in the
`[-2^11, 2^11 - 1]` range. It can be represented by the C type:

```
struct osd_point_t {
    int x: 12;
    int y: 12;
} __attribute__((packed));
```

### osd_size_t 
A size with 12 bit signed `width` and `height` fields, both in the
`[-2^11, 2^11 - 1]` range. It can be represented by the C type:

```
struct osd_size_t {
    int width: 12;
    int height: 12;
} __attribute__((packed));
```
Note that this type is binary equivalent to `osd_point_t`.

### osd_rect_t
A rectangle with an origin of type `osd_point_t` and a size of type
`osd_size_t`. It can be represented by the C type:

```
struct osd_rect_t {
    osd_point_t point;
    osd_size_t size;
} __attribute__((packed));
```

### osd_chr_data_t
The visible data and metadata for for a 12x18 2bpp character. Visible data consists
of 54 bytes while metadata takes 10 bytes, for a total of 64 bytes. It can be
represented by the C type:

```
struct osd_chr_data_t {
    uint8_t data[54];
    uint8_t metadata[10];
}
```

### color_t (uint8_t)
Available colors for drawing.

Values:
- `COLOR_BLACK` = 0
- `COLOR_TRANSPARENT` = 1
- `COLOR_WHITE` = 2
- `COLOR_GRAY` = 3

### outline_t (uint8_t)
Available types of outlines.

Values:
- `OUTLINE_TYPE_NONE` = 0
- `OUTLINE_TYPE_TOP` = 1 << 0
- `OUTLINE_TYPE_RIGHT` = 1 << 1
- `OUTLINE_TYPE_BOTTOM` = 1 << 2
- `OUTLINE_TYPE_LEFT` = 1 << 3

### uvarint_t
Unsigned integer encoded using variable length. The value is encoded in
little endian order with 7 bits per byte. The final byte must have its MSB
clear (i.e. value < 128), while intermediate bytes must have it set
(i.e. value >= 128).

The following C functions can be used to encode and decode an uvarint_t.

```
// Returns the number of bytes used
static inline int osd_cmd_encode_uvarint(uint8_t *ptr, size_t size, uint32_t val)
{
    unsigned ii = 0;
    while (val > 0x80)
    {
        if (ii >= size)
        {
            return -1;
        }
        ptr[ii] = (val & 0xFF) | 0x80;
        val >>= 7;
        ii++;
    }
    if (ii >= size)
    {
        return -1;
    }
    ptr[ii] = val & 0xFF;
    return ii + 1;
}

// Returns the number of bytes used, or < 0 if value can't be decoded
// into an uint32_t
static inline int osd_cmd_decode_uvarint(uint32_t *val, const uint8_t *ptr, size_t size)
{
    unsigned s = 0;
    *val = 0;
    for (size_t ii = 0; ii < size; ii++)
    {
        uint8_t b = ptr[ii];
        if (b < 0x80)
        {
            if (ii > 5 || (ii == 5 && b > 1))
            {
                // uint32_t overflow
                return -2;
            }
            *val |= ((uint32_t)b) << s;
            return ii + 1;
        }
        *val |= ((uint32_t)(b & 0x7f)) << s;
        s += 7;
    }
    // no value could be decoded and we have no data left
    return -1;
}
```

- `row` **unsigned:4**
- `opts` **unsigned:3**
- `str_size` **unsigned:4** For sizes <= 15. Otherwise set to 0 and use `str_variable_size`
- `str_variable_size` **uvarint_t** Only present if `str_size = 0`
- `str` **const char \*** NOT NULL array of characters

### OSD_CMD_WIDGET_SET_CONFIG = 115     (Since API 2)
Configure a widget identified by its `widget_id`. Widgets must be
configured before they can be drawn. Typically, this should be called
once per widget during startup. Updates should be performed with
`OSD_CMD_WIDGET_DRAW`. Since configuration data varies by widget,
the payload changes depenending on `widget_id`. See [WIDGETS](WIDGETS.md) for
additional information.

### OSD_CMD_WIDGET_DRAW = 116           (Since API 2)
Draws the widget identified by its `widget_id`. If the widget was already drawn,
it will delete itself manipulating the minimum required amount of pixels before
redrawing. Since the displayed data varies by widget, the payload changes depenending
on `widget_id`. See [WIDGETS](WIDGETS.md) for additional information.

### OSD_CMD_WIDGET_ERASE = 117          (Since API 2)
Erases the widget identified by its `widget_id`. Note that widgets know how to
redraw themselves while minimizing the amount of operations, so you should
only manually erase them if you want to remove them from the screen.

Arguments:
- `widget_id` **uint8_t**

### OSD_CMD_REBOOT = 120
Reboots the OSD

Arguments:
- `to_bootloader` **uint8_t** Values > 0 cause the OSD to reboot and wait for
  an update in bootloader mode

### OSD_CMD_WRITE_FLASH = 121
Used by the bootloader to provide firmware upgrades. 

### OSD_CMD_SET_DATA_RATE = 122
Changes the data rate of the OSD temporarily until the next reboot.
When using the UART API, the argument indicates the new `bps`.
The change of speed is performed after the response to this command
has been sent to the host.

Arguments:
- `data_rate` **uint32_t** Requested data rate

Returns:
- `new_data_rate` **uint32_t** New data rate set. Might be different than the requested
